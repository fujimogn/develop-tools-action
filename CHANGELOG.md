## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-12

### Fixed

- Tests use `grep` instead of `rg`, which GitHub-hosted runners do not provide; a missing `rg` had let the token-leak check pass silently.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- Composite action to install manifest-pinned Linux x86_64 develop tools from a private GitHub Release using a caller-provided token.
- Verification against the committed SHA256 and release checksum list before installation.
- Offline fixture tests and CI for successful installation, checksum rejection, and token-free logs.
